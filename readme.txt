This is a collection of my qbasic programs written in the 90's and early 00's. Each program originated from a concept that I wanted to learn and explore. 

For this 2011 release:
 - Performed minor cleanup such as removing outdated contact info.
 - Tested with QB 4.5 (with /l qb.qlb) in DOSBox. 
 - QB64 does not properly run many programs due to low level access and unsuppored functions

 - original modified date: 2/9/2001 4:33 PM

 - Does not work in qb 4.5 but I'm pretty sure it worked in qbasic.exe
